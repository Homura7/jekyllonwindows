## Overview
Whether youâ€™re using Markdown or HTML, Jekyll makes it easy for you to insert beautiful code blocks into your pages.
 
As of v3.x Jekyll now uses Rouge as the default syntax highlighter. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-syntax-highlighting-on-github-pages/">Github</a> only supports Rouge. 

There is still support for the older Pygments.rb highlighter but its use for new projects is not recommended. More information can be found on the [official Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting).

## Install Rouge
Quick and painless: Open your favorite command line tool and enter the following command.
 
```
gem install rouge
```

Then, in your `_config.yml`, set Rouge as your syntax highlighter:

```
highlighter: rouge
```

Done!
